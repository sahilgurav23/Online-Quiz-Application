# How to Start the Application

## PowerShell Execution Policy Issue

If you encounter the error about scripts being disabled, you have two options:

### Option 1: Use Command Prompt (Recommended)
1. Open **Command Prompt** (cmd.exe)
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```cmd
   cd d:\Projects\Online-Quiz-Application\online-quiz
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```cmd
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Enable PowerShell Scripts (Temporary)
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd d:\Projects\Online-Quiz-Application\online-quiz
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

## Starting the Application

Once you've resolved the execution policy:

1. **Start the Backend API** (if not already running):
   ```cmd
   cd d:\Projects\Online-Quiz-Application\Quiz Api\Quiz Api
   dotnet run
   ```
   The API should start at: http://localhost:5079

2. **Start the Frontend** (in a new terminal):
   ```cmd
   cd d:\Projects\Online-Quiz-Application\online-quiz
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app should start at: http://localhost:3000

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
